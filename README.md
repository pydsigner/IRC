### IRC: A general purpose IRC interface for Python

IRC is based heavily on the Bunbot of Alan Bunbury (bunburya), available freely
from GitHub (https://github.com/bunburya/bunbot). The code was fetched on
26 November 2011, and may now be different. This code may, at the author's
discretion, be rebased on a newer version of Bunbot; this will be duly noted.
However, this IRC interface contains a much greater amount of features than
Bunbury's, and often provides simpler handling than Twisted.

The changes below are not mentioned in the Git log:

* Random coding style changes
* Generalization of bot.Bot()
* A few docstring additions
* Cross-version Python compatibility
