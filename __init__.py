'''
IRC: A general purpose IRC interface for Python

IRC is based heavily on the Bunbot of Alan Bunbury (bunburya), available freely 
from GitHub (https://github.com/bunburya/bunbot). The code was fetched on 
26 November 2011, and may now be different. This code may, at the author's 
discretion, be rebased on a newer version of Bunbot; this will be duly noted.

The most significant changes:

* Random coding style changes
* Generalization of bot.Bot()
* A few docstring additions
* Cross-version Python compatibility
